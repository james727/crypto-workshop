This repository contains the document for a cryptography workshop I gave at the Recurse center on November 2nd, 2016. Links and resources for reference and further learning:

1. [Stanford Crypto on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/) - A great intro to the theory of cryptography. It covers a lot of the basics we skipped over in the workshop.
2. [The Cryptopals Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) - A series of crypto challenges that will have you first implementing various crypto constructs, and then breaking them in a variety of ways. Skip to set 5 if you're only interested in the stuff talked about in workshop (here are the challenges for implementing [Diffie Hellman](http://cryptopals.com/sets/5/challenges/33) and [RSA](http://cryptopals.com/sets/5/challenges/39)). I cannot recommend these enough.
3. [A great description of the RSA cipher](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/rsa.html#1) - A well-explained overview of a lot of the material covered in the workshop. Provides a better explanation than I did of a lot of the concepts necessary to understand RSA.
4. [Quadibloc - articles on crypto history and algorithms](http://www.quadibloc.com/crypto/jscrypt.htm) - I've wasted a lot of time here..
